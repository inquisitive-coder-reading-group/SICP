/*
Exercise 1.4: Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

/**
*  An `if` conditional returns an addition operator if b

*  operator. Then, that operator is applied to operands a and b.
