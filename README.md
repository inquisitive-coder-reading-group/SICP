# Welcome to SICP!

Here you'll find implementations of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs exercises in everyone's favorite language: Swift.

Whether you're a seasoned developer with a sense of curiosity or a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft, you've come to the right place!

## Process
Each SICP chapter contains a number of exercises. ICRG reads through 1-2 chapters for every meeting. In advance of each meeting, as you tackle individual exercises, feel free to open a pull request for that exercise (or if someone else has already opened one for that exercise, weigh in on the discussion). We'll refine the implementation of each exercise as a group.

When we meet each month, we'll wrangle the outstanding pull requests into mergable shape, voice any outstanding thoughts, and hit the `merge` button.

## Notes

- Branch naming: exercise branch names should follow the naming scheme `username`/exercise-`exercise number`
